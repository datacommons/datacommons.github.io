<h2>Make a donation</h2>

<p>
The Data Commons Cooperative enables its members to share the information we need to create a more democratic economy. DCC is a network owned and controlled by its members; each member contributes what they know and any member can use that data for their needs. By providing democratic access to information, DCC helps reduce costs and redundancy, and strengthens our movement by creating tools and facilitating projects that augment our membersâ€™ work.
</p>

<p>
All donors are listed in our annual reports, distributed to all
members, for a minimum of 5 years after their donation. If you donate $100 or less, your donation will be matched through a Fund for Democratic Communities matching grant.
