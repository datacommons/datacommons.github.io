**What is the Data Commons Cooperative?**
The Data Commons Cooperative is an organization owned and run by its 38 members and growing, who wish to share the costs and benefits of sharing information about economic activities that constitute the social economy. We believe we can do more by working together than we can on our own, and we believe that a decentralized, collaborative, network approach is more powerful and sustainable than a centralized strategy. Democratic access to information will best serve our collective desire to create a more democratic economy.

**What is the Patchwork Census?**
Some years ago, the Data Commons Co-op put together [find.coop](http://find.coop), a prototype of how directory information--from multiple databases of groups working on alternative economies--could be pooled and presented. Documentation of alternative economic initiatives through census projects in different regions across the country is becoming systematic and repeatable; there’s the opportunity to make this vision of a comprehensive directory real.

Some of the census projects that are being added to find.coop now include:

* co-op censuses of ME, NH, VT, MA, RI, CT, NY, NJ, PA and CO

* a national directory of food co-ops and buying clubs)

* the research results of solidarityeconomy.us

* a national census of limited-equity housing co-ops)

* a national directory of cooperative development centers and professionals

**We propose to:**
Continue to add content to find.coop using the results of ongoing census work.
Automate this process, so that as census work continues, find.coop updates.

When census work yields an online spreadsheet, it will be shared with a special collaborator called the Data Commons Bot. From a spreadsheet owner’s perspective, they simply invite datacommonsbot@gmail.com and grant read access. The bot runs on a secure server, pulling in fresh updates of the spreadsheet whenever changes are made. This bot has already been built, and is used for various directories, but has not yet been applied to find.coop.

**What is the tech part of the project?**
We propose to:
Share census spreadsheets with the Data Commons Bot
Teach the bot how to read a list of organizations and locations from each spreadsheet
Write a module to aggregate these lists into a single large list
Convert that list into a form readable by the find.coop website
Assemble these steps into a repeatable pipeline hosted by the Data Commons Co-op
