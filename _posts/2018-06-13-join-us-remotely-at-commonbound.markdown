Next week will be the amazing [CommonBound conference 2018](http://www.commonbound.org/). If you are coming and you are interested in how we share data for the new economy, please sign up for [Data-Mapping for the New Economy](http://sched.co/E3RV):

> The movement needs good data about itself—and to be relevant data must be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This gathering will bring together organizations and researchers working on gathering information on the “new” (social/solidarity/cooperative) economy to come to a shared understanding on basic issues such as taxonomies (categories and definitions), technical infrastructure needs, and good practices for gathering, sharing, maintaining, and displaying data. All are welcome, but this will make most sense to those who spend time and resources on these tasks.

If you can’t be there, no problem! We are going to be broadcasting live through Zoom, so you can join by video conference or phone. Here is the invitation (please forward it to your friends and networks):
