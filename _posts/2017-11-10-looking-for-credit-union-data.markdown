Thanks to solidarity economy researcher Craig Borowiak, one of the lead researchers behind [solidarityeconomy.us](http://solidarityeconomy.us), for these tips on getting the latest information on credit unions from the National Credit Union Administration. 
1. Go to the NCUA homepage: [https://www.ncua.gov/Pages/default.aspx](https://www.ncua.gov/Pages/default.aspx)
2. At the bottom of the page, look for heading "Credit Union Analysis". Beneath that you will see a link to "Call Report Data". Click on that.
3. That takes you to: [https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/call-report-data.aspx](https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/call-report-data.aspx). Click on "Quarterly Data".
4. That takes you to: [https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/call-report-data/quarterly-data.aspx](https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/call-report-data/quarterly-data.aspx). Click on whichever quarter you'd like.
5. That will download a zip drive of files. To find current credit union addresses, select "Credit Union Branch Information", which is a comma separated text file. You can then convert that to a CSV file in Excel. 
6. There's loads of other credit union data besides contact info. 

Happy credit union data updating!
