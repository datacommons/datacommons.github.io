## New mailing list

<div class="section">

We invite members of the co-op, board members, staff, techies, and
friends of the co-op to subscribe to a new mailing list: [`datacommons@lists.riseup.net`](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/datacommons).
This is a list for members, staff, and board to mingle and talk things over,
and get a sense for the pulse of the co-op.
It has public archives. For any private concerns start with an email to [`info@datacommons.coop`]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/) instead.
