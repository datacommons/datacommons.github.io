title: Going Global?

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">The Data Commons Cooperative is made up of organizations from the U.S. and Canada, and is working on integrating data from those regions.<span>  </span>We've been pleased by a few recent inquiries<span>  </span>- from Indonesia and from the U.K. - about why we're limiting our regional scope.<span>  </span>Why not go global?<span>    </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">The answer is that we are and we aren't.<span>   </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">From a tech perspective, we hope that our work will catch on and reach all corners of the globe.<span>   </span>The software we are developing - the tools for sharing - are licensed as open source platforms and we would love if people from everywhere would install, develop,<span>  </span>and contribute to maintaining them.<span>   </span>Our tools are made to be decentralized and if there were many installations, it would set the stage for a much larger collaboration.<span>  </span>Primarily I'm referring to:</p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Commons</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Directory software</span>, which we are using to for <a href="http://find.coop/">find.coop</a> and assorted subdomains.<span>  </span>Instructions for downloading and installing the software locally are available at <a href="http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Data_Commons_Directory">cultivate.coop</a>.<span>  </span>Bugs can be reported at our <a href="https://launchpad.net/datacommons">launchpad</a> site.<span>   </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coopy diff/patch tool</span>, our longer term development for creating synchronization between databases, is available at <a href="http://share.find.coop/">share.find.coop</a>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Software development </span>in general is not limited to any region.<span>   </span>A lot of our work is volunteer, but sometimes we have paid projects.<span>  </span>If you are interested in getting involved with our current tech team, join our <a href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/directorytech">tech email list</a> and say hello.<span>    </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-weight: bold; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Where we <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> regionally limiting ourselves is in the membership of our nascent cooperative.<span>   </span>There are two major reasons for this.<span>  </span>One is that it helps us organizationally to start with a smaller group, in nearby time zones, to hammer out our structure and business model.<span>   </span>The second is that sharing data is a leap of faith for some organizations that are concerned about the privacy of their constituency.<span>  </span>Members want to be able to control what gets shared , and having a smaller group, many of whom work with each other on other projects, helps us with trust as work through bugs on this front.<span>  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">So: the software is available globally, our current membership is regional for now, with an eye on the larger world as our organization grows.<span>     </span></p>
