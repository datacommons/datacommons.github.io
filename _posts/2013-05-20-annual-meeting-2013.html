<ul></ul><h1>Jamie Campbell</h1>
<p>Jamie Campbell has been a member of Manitoba's co-op community since his arrival in the spring of 2005.  He works for two worker co-ops, ParIT Worker Co-operative (<a href="http://www.parit.ca">www.parit.ca</a>)  and Mondragon Bookstore and Coffeehouse (<a href="http://www.mondragon.ca">www.mondragon.ca</a>).  He joined both the CWCF (<a href="http://www.canadianworker.coop/">www.canadianworker.coop</a>) Board and the Manitoba Community Co-operative Strategy's (<a href="http://www.manitoba.coop/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Complete-Strategy-Jan-2010.pdf">http://www.manitoba.coop/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Complete-Strategy-Jan-2010.pdf</a>) “Supports and Services” working group in 2010.  He currently sits on the board of the Albert Street Autonomous Zone Co-op (<a href="http://a-zone.org/">a-zone.org</a>), is ParIT's liason to the Winnipeg Parecon Worker Council (a local organization facilitating co-operation between local worker-owned and run enterprises), and is a founding board member with Data Commons.  He is currently working on becoming trilingual (English, French, and Spanish) to be able to serve members of all three communities, which each have substantial presence in co-op communities both locally and globally.  The upcoming feature that Jamie is most interested in is the Marketplace, to enable co-ops to not only find each other but also directly engage in commerce with each other.  This interest is rooted in Jamie's “keeping an eye on the bottom line” worker co-op sensibilities.</p>

<h1>Ethan Miller</h1>
<p>Ethan Miller is a writer, researcher, educator, and organizer whose primary work focuses on imagining and cultivating democratic, equitable and ecological forms of livelihood. As one of the co-founders of the Data Commons, Ethan is excited about building practical tools (both conceptual and physical) that can help us to create and sustain solidarity-based economies. He has written and led many workshops on solidarity economics, and is a long-time member of the Grassroots Economic Organizing media collective (<a href="http://www.geo.coop">www.geo.coop</a>) and, more recently, the Community Economies Collective (<a href="http://www.communityeconomies.org">www.communityeconomies.org</a>). Ethan has a Master's degree in geography from Umass Amherst, where he studied alternative concepts of regional economic development, and is currently working on a PhD dissertation as a student in Social and Political Thought at the University of Western Sydney (in Australia). His research focuses on rethinking the concepts of “economy, ecology and society” in ways that challenge problematic distinctions between nature and culture, and open up more space to think and act ethically in the face of interdependence, injustice and uncertainty. This sounds really theoretical, and it is, but the work itself is grounded in extensive conversations with economic developers and ecological defenders in Maine regarding the practical possibilities for developing new shared stories about what it means to live together in this wild and challenging world. When not in Oz (like right now, doing fieldwork back home), Ethan lives, works, plays and tends the orchard with his partner Kate, his 5-month-old son Loren, and a bunch of other great people at the JED Collective, a cooperative homestead in Greene, Maine.</p>

His background is in cultural organizing, as co-founder of the Groundswell Collective, a group of artists/activists who produce and research critical cultural works, and as a committee member the HONK! Festival of activist street bands for more than five years.
