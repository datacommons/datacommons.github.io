<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Our president, <a href="http://www.marraffino.org/">Joe Marraffino</a> is moving on.  He is now Finance Manager at <a href="http://www.greenstar.coop/">GreenStar</a> Natural Foods Market.  From our board:</p>
<p>“I think I speak for everyone when I say, we couldn't have made it this far without you and your hard work and creativity! Thank you so much for all you've done, and good luck with your new job at Greenstar.”</p>
<p>“Agreed, many thanks to President Emeritus Joe!  Greenstar is lucky to have you.”</p>
<p>“Same here! You were the linchpin that really took us to the next level, Joe. Thanks for everything, and I'm sure Greenstar is already benefiting greatly from your talents.”</p>
<p>“I just want to echo everyone's thanks and well wishes. Your work for Data Commons *really* made it possible for us to take things to a new level, and if we succeed (which we will!!!), your care, work and skill will be one of the crucial ingredients. Thanks!!!”</p>

<p>So that's all well and good for Greenstar, but what about the DCC? We're delighted to say that <a href="http://www.communityeconomies.org/people/Ethan-Miller">Ethan Miller</a> has agreed to take on the role of president.  Ethan has played a profound role in shaping our co-op, since the beginning.  In fact, the DCC's roots can be traced back to Ethan's “Economy of Hope” initiative at GEO, around the turn of the century.  Ethan is a visionary with a heart, and a pleasure to work with.  Excellent qualities in a president!</p>
