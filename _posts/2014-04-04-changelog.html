    <h1>Data Commons Change Report</h1>

    <div class="changes" id="intro">

      The Data Commons Co-op is beginning to systematically archive
      databases, spreadsheets, or online lists.  The Change Report
      is an experiment in giving our members insight into the scope
      of the data the co-op holds on their behalf.  For now, we give
      raw listings of new material that has come in.  Apologies to
      members who have chipped in data that we're not yet processing
      and reporting.  <b>All errors are our own</b>.
