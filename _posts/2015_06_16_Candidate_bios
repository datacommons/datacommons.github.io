<h2>Julia Poznik</h2>
<h3>Biography:</h3>
<p>I am a graduate student interested in studying and promoting the cooperative business model as a tool for radical systemic change. By the end of this summer I will have completed my coursework and be ready to begin dissertation research and writing. The degree sought is an interdisciplinary PhD in Economics (co-discipline: Social Sciences Consortium) at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. My department takes a heterodox and pluralist approach to the study of economics and therefore we do not confine ourselves to the textbook (neoclassical) school of economics that is dominant in academia (and politics). Personally, I am studying economics in search of a better system of provisioning - one that incorporates environmental concerns and promotes a more equitable and just society. I think cooperatives are a key aspect of that alternative economy and am excited by all the work being done to promote democracy in the workplace. I recently coauthored a case study on the Greater University Circle Initiative, a public-private-philanthropic based effort to revitalize the local economy of Cleveland, OH using environmental and economic justice conscientious programs. My future research will continue to explore, critique, and promote creative approaches to increasing democracy and environmentalism within our economy.</p>

<p>Before commencing my graduate studies I was the office manager of a medium sized non-profit that promoted sustainable urban planning. This experience distilled in me an appreciation for alternative transportation and smart zoning that promotes community and efficient use of city resources. I am also interested in local food systems and view them as a vital (and delicious) aspect of the new economy. Worker cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives have long been an interest of mine, both as a topic of academic inquiry and as a personal way of life. I helped create and worked in a collectively managed cafe and have lived in housing cooperatives. These passions motivated me to return to school so that I may better serve the movement for economic democracy. I am interested in serving as a board member of the Data Commons in order to facilitate a deepening of the relationship between cooperatives and academics to their mutual benefit. </p>
