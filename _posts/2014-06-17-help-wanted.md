title: Food co-op / buying club enthusiast wanted
simple: true

Do you know your way around the food co-op and buying club scene?
Would you be interested
in helping moderate perhaps the longest-lived online cooperative directory around?
If so, <a href="/contact/">drop us a note</a> telling us a little bit
about yourself and any food co-ops or buying clubs you participate in.
No special skills needed, just the ability to edit an online spreadsheet.

Some background:
From 1999 through 2011, the Cooperating Directory Service, a Minnesota
non-profit initially funded from the estate of Kris Olsen,
operated a directory of natural food co-ops at [coopdirectory.org](http://coopdirectory.org).
When the CDS non-profit closed in 2011, Stuart Reid of the Food Co-op
Initiative was asked to take it on.  He, in turn, checked in with the nascent
Data Commons (of which the Food Co-op Initiative is a founding member)
to see what it could do to help.
A Data Commons volunteer did some basic triage on the site, cleaning it
up, structuring the listings, and saving submissions and corrections made 
via the site from falling into a black hole.
At the end of triaging, the website was living and breathing again.
It turns out to be a popular website, well-ranked in search engines,
with a healthy number of updates coming in every month.  It just
isn't in anyone's business plan or monetization strategy!
We'd like to keep it that way. <a href="/contact/">Can you help?</a>

Along with moderators, we'd be super-excited if any web design guru
wants to freshen the look of the site a little bit, but for now we're
keeping its old-timey look, right down to the milometer-style
visitor counter!

This is an all-volunteer effort right now, with the Data Commons Co-op
guaranteeing continued hosting and attention. Financial assistance would
be very welcome!
