<p>The Data Commons Cooperative [1] is looking for people to serve on its Board of Directors.  The co-op was founded in July 2012 to improve  information flow in the cooperative/solidarity/new economy.  If you like to push the edge of what can be done with co-ops, and think the infrastructure of the ethical economy could do with some love - we want you!  Serving on the co-op board is an excellent way to make sure the voice of your community is heard clearly, and to guide the co-op in productive directions.</p>
<p>Directors are nominated and elected by co-op members.  Existing members  of the co-op are generally umbrella organizations or projects that  represent a region, sector, or movement (and are listed in this call). Each member may make two nominations.  The current board encourages  members to consider using one of their nominations to sponsor motivated  individuals active in their community to step forward.  The board  stands ready to help with any match-making needed, and encourages  passionate individuals to respond to this call without necessarily  having a confirmed sponsoring member.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="about-the-data-commons-co-op" href="#about-the-data-commons-co-op" id="about-the-data-commons-co-op"></a>About the Data Commons Co-op</h2>
<p>People everywhere have been organizing a more ethical economy, but they work in relative isolation, fragmented by geography, sector, and even organizational form.</p>
<p>Many communities gather information about a small piece of these efforts. In every situation, there is another community for which that information overlaps. In every case there is an opportunity to share that will strengthen all the communities participating.  But that requires effort, it requires trust, and it requires infrastructure. It requires, in short, a co-op!</p>
<p>The Data Commons Co-op is a cooperative of organizations that are figuring out how their disparate communities can work together, both technically and culturally, to benefit from their overlap without blunting their difference.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="board-member-duties" href="#board-member-duties" id="board-member-duties"></a>Board member duties</h2>
<p>Your basic duty is a 3-hour commitment per month.  One hour of that is a regular board meeting (by phone).  The remainder is reading and and responding to board business (by email).</p>
<p>There are various roles that go beyond that baseline.  These are strictly  voluntary, and currently filled by the 5 current board members (the role  of treasurer is held in interim).  Those roles include:</p>
<ul><li>Officer roles - treasurer, secretary, president</li>
<li>Membership committee - read member applications, make recommendations</li>
<li>Data trust - check out incoming data, make recommendations </li>
<li>Operations team - work with the people coordinating the day-to-day  activity of co-op</li>
<li>Tech team - work with the people who move the bits around</li>
</ul><p>A variety of term durations are possible, from 1 to 3 years.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="qualifications" href="#qualifications" id="qualifications"></a>Qualifications</h2>
<p>The key formal requirement is that you must represent the interests of  at least one of our existing members.  Directors are nominated and  elected by the co-op members.  Nominees need to be "employed by or  connected with or representing" a member organization [2].  Check the list of member organizations included towards the end of this call.  If your interests overlap with one or more members, they may well be interested in nominating you as part of their board representation (each member can nominate up to two board members).  We'd be happy to help with any match-making needed.  If you belong to  a group that isn't yet a member but you think it should be, let us know  so that we can reach out, or you can direct the group to our member  information packet [3].</p>
<p>A general qualification is having an interest in the development of  infrastructure for sharing data in and about the ethical economy.  You just won't have any fun in the co-op otherwise.</p>
