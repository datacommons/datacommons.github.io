<p>The Data Commons Cooperative is on a mission to create a democratically controlled, accurate, comprehensive, publicly searchable and updatable database of cooperative economic initiatives.  We want to make knowledge of the history, current state, and evolution of the cooperative economy - as defined by its participants - a public good that all can draw on.</p>
<p>That's the easy part.  Here's the kicker.  We want that database to survive.  We've seen too many similar initiatives come and go.  We're not looking to build a website that will one day die of neglect.  Or to accumulate a privately-held data trove that will one day disappear into a black hole.  Or to paint ourselves into a corner with disagreements about policing community boundaries.  We're looking for tech folk with experience with community aspects of  software development to help shape our vision of how to do data  collaboration right.</p>
<p>Here's what we've been doing so far.  We've been following two lines of development, one CONVENTIONAL and one CRAZY.  We need help with both, and in getting them to meet.</p>
<!--break--> <p>On the CONVENTIONAL front, we're building an online directory of cooperative economic initiatives (<a href="http://find.coop/">find.coop</a>) that can be edited wiki-style.  There are themed, filtered views of different slices of the directory, so different communities can have their own directory without balkanizing the data itself.  The code for the directory is free and open source.  It is written in Ruby on Rails.  We're looking for excellent web developers to push this work forward.  If you're not a Ruby developer, please don't let that turn you off -  if you've worked with django or other MVC frameworks, you'll be able to  run along just fine. We also need folks with other skill sets, including graphic design and  ETL experience to help import data from our data sharing partners.</p> <p>On the CRAZY front, we're looking at repeating the history of distributed software development, but this time for data.  We've created a diff/patch tool specialized for databases, and experimented with adapting a distributed revision control system to data-collection projects (see <a href="http://share.find.coop/">share.find.coop</a>).  This technology seems remote and obscure to non techies, but it could change data-sharing across partially overlapping communities from being a pain to being fun.  The code for this work is also free and open source.  It is written in C++.</p> <p>We're also making use of emerging data services such as the Data Hub (formerly CKAN), and ScraperWiki, to release member-contributed data as early as possible.  We're working to get this data under clear open data licenses, analogous to free software licenses.</p><p>All of our work is open source.  Programmers who want an opportunity to learn are welcome.  Most of our work is done on a volunteer basis, with some paid projects arising as our funding allows.  So far members of the Data Commons Cooperative are all in the US and Canada, but the cooperative economy doesn't have borders.</p> <p><a href="../contact">Contact us</a> with a brief description of your interest, and we'll find a way to plug you in.
