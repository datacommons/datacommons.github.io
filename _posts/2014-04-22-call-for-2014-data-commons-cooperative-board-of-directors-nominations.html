title: Call for 2014 Data Commons Cooperative Board of Directors Nominations
---

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><h1><strong>Call for board member nominations</strong></h1>
<p>The Data Commons Cooperative [1] is looking for people to serve on  its Board of Directors.  We particularly encourage nominations from marginalized and underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>The co-op was founded in July 2012 to improve   information flow in the cooperative/solidarity/new economy.  If you like  to push the edge of what can be done with co-ops, and think the  infrastructure of the ethical economy could do with some love - we want  you!  Serving on the co-op board is an excellent way to make sure the  voice of your community is heard clearly, and to guide the co-op in  productive directions.</p>
<p>Directors are nominated and elected by co-op members.  Existing  members  of the co-op are generally umbrella organizations or projects  that  represent a region, sector, or movement (and are listed in this  call). Each member may make two nominations.  The current board  encourages  members to consider using one of their nominations to  sponsor motivated  individuals active in their community to step  forward.  The board  stands ready to help with any match-making needed,  and encourages  passionate individuals to respond to this call without  necessarily  having a confirmed sponsoring member.</p>

<p>People everywhere have been organizing a more ethical economy, but  they work in relative isolation, fragmented by geography, sector, and  even organizational form.</p>
<p>Many communities gather information about a small piece of these  efforts. In every situation, there is another community for which that  information overlaps. In every case there is an opportunity to share  that will strengthen all the communities participating.  But that  requires effort, it requires trust, and it requires infrastructure. It  requires, in short, a co-op!</p>
<p>The Data Commons Co-op is a cooperative of organizations that are  figuring out how their disparate communities can work together, both  technically and culturally, to benefit from their overlap without  blunting their difference.</p>
<h2><strong><a id="board-member-duties" class="anchor" name="board-member-duties" href="http://datacommons.find.coop/content/join-our-board-updated#board-member-duties"></a>Board member duties</strong></h2>
<p>Your basic duty is a 3-hour commitment per month.  One hour of that  is a regular board meeting (by phone).  The remainder is reading and and  responding to board business (by email).</p>
<p>There are various roles that go beyond that baseline.  These are  strictly  voluntary, and will be selected at the first board meeting after the election).  Those roles include:</p>
<ul><li>Officer roles - treasurer, secretary, president</li>
<li>Operations team - work with the people coordinating the day-to-day  activity of co-op</li>
<li>DCC Development Team- Phase 1: Draft a development plan and vision for the DCC using member and Board input. Phase 2: Generate the resources to implement it.</li>
<li>Tech team - work with the people who move the bits around</li>
<li>Membership committee - read member applications, make recommendations</li>
<li>Data trust - check out incoming data, make recommendations</li>
</ul><p>Terms are for 3 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2>
<p>The key formal requirement is that you must be connected to at least one of our existing members.  Directors are nominated and   elected by the co-op members.  Nominees need to be "employed by or   connected with or representing" a member organization [2].  Check the  list of member organizations included towards the end of this call.  If  your interests overlap with one or more members, they may well be  interested in nominating you as part of their board representation (each  member can nominate up to two board members).  We'd be happy to help  with any match-making needed.  If you belong to  a group that isn't yet a  member but you think it should be, let us know  so that we can reach  out, or you can direct the group to our member  information packet [3].</p>
<p>A general qualification is having an interest in the development of   infrastructure for sharing data in and about the ethical economy.  You  just won't have any fun in the co-op otherwise.<strong><em> </em><br /></strong></p>
