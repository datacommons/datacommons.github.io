We'd like to welcome our latest member, the [Cooperative Grocer Network](http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop).
CGN is:

> a nonprofit, 501(c)6 trade association intent on strengthening all retail food co-ops by a creating an online community of cooperators who can develop and share their best resources and practices.

Here's how Dan Nordley reacted when the Data Commons Co-op board 
approved CGN's membership:

> please accept my ... exclamation of appreciation and pride for being accepted to perhaps the geekiest of all cooperative organizations on the planet!!  Woot!

We reckon Dan's going to fit right in :-).  For the record, 
the DCC has the standard cooperative principles burned into its
[bylaws](http://member.datacommons.coop/bylaws#__RefHeading__4_2007227463),
including the principle of voluntary and open membership:

> <b>1st Principle: Voluntary and Open Membership.</b> Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.

So we are committed to being open to all ([join now!](http://member.datacommons.coop/applications/new)). The responsibilities of membership and the nature of our services are definitely kind of geeky.  The geekiest of all cooperative organizations on the planet?  We don't know, maybe the [International Ice Core Data Cooperative](http://www.cricyt.edu.ar/paleo/icecore/iicdc.html) set up by a bunch of paleoclimatologists has us beat&nbsp;- but we know the planet needs more of them.
