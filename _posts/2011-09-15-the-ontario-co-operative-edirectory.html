title: The Ontario Co-operative eDirectory

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>The <a href="http://www.ontario.coop/find_a_coop">Ontario Co-operative Association</a> has a nicely designed "eDirectory" for finding cooperatives in the province.   Categorization tags are done by the businesses market (Dairy) rather then by cooperative sector (Consumer).  The directory is complemented by educational and promotional materials.  Updates can be emailed to them, centralizing maintenance, though it probably helps that <a href="http://www.cbo-eco.ca/en/index.cfm/guides/co-operatives-info-guide/">all co-operatives must register</a> with the provincial government, unlike the United States where there is no governmentally maintained list.</p>
