## Information Maintenance

 * Periodic pull updates
 
 > Data Commons keeps its member data updated, preferably in an automated fashion, and avoids the “stale data” problem that has consistently plagued similar efforts. 

 * Push updates

 > Data Commons enables its members to trigger updates of their own information.


## Information Display

 * Central website

 > Data Commons enables members to access available information through a website maintained by the Data Commons co-op.


 * Programmatically retrieved data

 > Data Commons enables members to display Data Commons data on their own sites, devices, etc by providing the ability to programmatically “pull” data.

 * Online Members Marketplace

 > Data Commons provides an online marketplace to provide the ability for members to procure from each other.


## Information Deployment

 * Upstream Merging

 > Data Commons provides members with the ability to merge their own data sets with information from Data Commons.
